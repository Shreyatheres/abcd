This project is a comprehensive web application for managing campus activity hours, developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB. It features three distinct portals for students, administrators, and teachers. The application allows administrators to manage student registrations, add or delete events, and maintain participant lists. Students can browse available events, register for activities, view certificates, and access Google Drive links for event photos. Teachers can coordinate events and monitor participation. Additional functionalities include certificate generation and integration with Google Drive for storing event photos. This project showcases my skills in full-stack development, enhancing my proficiency in both frontend and backend technologies, particularly in Node.js and MongoDB.
